I wanted to see how the public schools in different states performed. Here is a heat map of the states by the percent of 
students who completed a degree. The hotter the color the better!

See the full analysis [here](https://github.com/sajafleming/CollegeScorecardAnalysis/blob/master/CollegeScorecardAnalysis.ipynb). Data for this project is from [this data.gov page](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/college-scorecard)

The next step is to see which state has the best return on investment.
